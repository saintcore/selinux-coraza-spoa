.SH "NAME"
coraza_spoa_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the coraza_spoa processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the coraza_spoa processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The coraza_spoa processes execute with the \fBcoraza_spoa_t\fP SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep coraza_spoa_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The \fBcoraza_spoa_t\fP SELinux type can be entered via the \fBcoraza_spoa_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the \fBcoraza_spoa_t\fP domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/coraza-spoa
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux coraza_spoa policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their coraza_spoa processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for coraza_spoa:

.EX
.B coraza_spoa_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a coraza_spoa_t
can be used to make the process type coraza_spoa_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux coraza_spoa policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their coraza_spoa processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following port types are defined for coraza_spoa:

.EX
.TP 5
.B coraza_spoa_port_t
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 9000
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type \fBcoraza_spoa_t\fP can manage files labeled with the following file types. The paths listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B coraza_config_t

        /etc/coraza-spoa(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B coraza_log_t

        /var/log/coraza-spoa(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B tmp_t

        /sandbox(/.*)?
.br
        /tmp
.br
        /usr/tmp
.br
        /var/tmp
.br
        /var/tmp
.br
        /tmp-inst
.br
        /var/tmp-inst
.br
        /var/tmp/tmp-inst
.br
        /var/tmp/vi\.recover
.br

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux coraza_spoa policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their coraza_spoa processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.I The following file types are defined for coraza_spoa:


.EX
.PP
.B coraza_config_t
.EE

- Set files with the coraza_config_t type, if you want to allow coraza_spoa to read and write configuration files.

.PP
.B coraza_log_t
.EE

- Set files with the coraza_log_t type, if you want to allow coraza_spoa to read, write and append to log files.

.PP
.B coraza_spoa_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the coraza_spoa_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the coraza_spoa_t domain.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
